# About

This is a rough, work-in-progress Java tool for parsing the Apache Cassandra commit log for a given period of time in the past, reading the affected rows from Cassandra, and then outputting them in other formats or databases. It includes output drivers for CSV files, PostgreSQL hstore and Oracle 11g.


# Usage

Build with Apache Ant, this project is not yet Mavenized.

Define your own input-output flows in the cont/exporter.conf file and invoke it from the command line parameters. Look into the provided configurations and shell files for examples. Right now the output mapping is quite rigid for each format and mostly a 1-to-1 mapping from the Cassandra rows.


# To do

- Mavenization
- Documentation
- Allow more than one output instance to be enabled
- Flexible, configurable input filters to deal better with fat rows
- Flexible output filters to deal with arbitrary SQL schemas
- Make it mostly scripting-driven instead of configuration-driven to solve previous problems, look into possible Java scripting engines
